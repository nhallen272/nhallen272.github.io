    <h3>Web Development Experience</h3>
    <p>My experience in HTML dates back to my high-school years and I am also proficient in Python and the web development framework, Django.
      
      When I worked at the ODU Computer Science Systems Group, a student-run IT group that supported the 
      department's IT assets, I expanded my computing skills and was also given the chance to do some web development. I coded two main websites, both using Django web development framework 
      Here are a couple of screenshots of web apps I have built.

    <h3>Co-author of research paper</h3>
    <p>In 2020, I was given the opportunity to co-author a paper during the height of the pandemic. My role in this was to code a Python script to periodically scrape video and save frames from a live webcam stream of a beach. The pictures and video were then analyzed using GIS software and open-source tools to measure the level of social distancing.</p>

    <h3>Raspberry Pi Oyster Float Project</h3>
    <p>During my internship at VMASC, I worked on a project to embed a Raspberry Pi inside a FlipCage oyster cultivation system to capture live video from a camera and record data from an Inertial Motion Unit (IMU). The IMU measures four types of motion data: angular velocity vector/gyroscope, acceleration, magnetic field strength, and gravitational acceleration. The underwater camera is mounted inside the cage and provides a live video stream of the oysters via YouTube.
        The code for this project was comprised of about 50/50 Python and bash scripts. The software development leveraged various utilities builtin to the Linux operating system such as creating System-d unit files and cron jobs to ensure the scripts were running at at appropriate times in the background as daemons.
        Another major aspect of this project was the design of a waterproof physical enclosure for the Raspberry Pi and the sensors. Since it wouldn't be possible to provide any wired power connection, we utilized batteries and solar panels to power the Pi. Using the CAD/3D modeling software, Fusion 360, we designed an enclosure that provides adequate protection from the environment and provides a way to mount the solar panels to power the system. The enclosure was 3D printed using ASA filament for increased resistance to sun damage. Since there was no clear way to mount the solar panels to the float, we designed parts that secured the panels to our enclosure in an innovative way.
        The GitHub page for the project can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/JShull/VABlueTech_FlipCam/tree/main">VABlueTech_FlipCam</a> </p>

    <h3>What is Containerization? Research Paper</h3>
    <p>In this paper, I researched what containerization is and how their security and performance compares to traditional forms of virtualization. An interdisciplinary research approach was used to combine the findings of computer science, cybersecurity, and digital forensics.  </p>

    <h3>ELK Stack Implementation</h3>
    <p>One of my achievements during my time at Systems Group was implementing an ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) cluster for the computer science department. The main funciton of this ELK stack was to track the uptime of 300+ lab machines owned by the department. 
        To setup the ELK stack for uptime monitoring, I configured Heartbeat to send ICMP pings and created a dashboard on Kibana to view it. </p>
